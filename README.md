# SortingLab
This lab is designed to analyze a series of sorting algorithms and compare running times. Done for my Algorithms and Data structures II class. 

Objectives, specifications, and details can be found at Sorting_Lab_Objectives.pdf (Included in this repository)

# Run it yourself
_These instructions are intended for Linux & Mac Users. It should be done within the terminal_

_Windows users should install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and conduct the deployment of this application within the terminal of that system._

    - Mac: [Follow this guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-in-macos/)

2. Use pip to install numpy by inputting <code>python3 -m pip install numpy</code>
3. Use an IDE of your choice to run the program, or run the program via the terminal by inputting <code>python3 sorting\[ID_REDACTED\].py</code>
